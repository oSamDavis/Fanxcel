## Features

- Augmented Livestreams: We offer an augmented live streaming experience that overlays 3D statistics on live games as users are viewing. Statistics such as ball speed, distance traveled, and pushing and passing yards that are captured by Sideline technology through various camera angles and the FTC, are securely transmitted to our platform. 
-  EmoCam: A highlight section that shows short emotional videos of players during games directed to user preferences. For example, we capture player interactions during pep talks from the coach during halftime or the moment a player gets his first down. 
-  AR Analytics: We provide an augmented reality system that enables users to view and interact with post-game statistics captured using various sideline technologies. For example, by overlaying player data captured by Zebra Technologies on top of video captured from the ‚Äúall-22‚Äù and endzone cameras, we are able to virtually map unique player stats unavailable to most sports streaming platforms. 
Watch Party: We provide fans with the ability to watch the game with a group of friends or family. Influencers and celebrities can also host watch parties for users to join. Watching a football game with a group fosters community and drives engagement.
- Trivia and Point System: We display various trivia questions during game breaks. Users can test their football knowledge and earn loyalty points for getting questions answered right. Points can be redeemed for premium app content.
- Integrity & Non-Obstruction: In an effort to ensure the integrity of the football game, we implement secure data sharing protocols and content screening to ensure no privileged or private information is disseminated publicly at the detriment of the players, the coaches, and the team.
